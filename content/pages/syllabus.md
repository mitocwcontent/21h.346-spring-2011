Subject Description
-------------------

The French Revolution of 1789 stands at the crossroads of modern French history, and perhaps of western and world history more generally. Since its outbreak, observers have debated the following questions: Why did the Revolution begin? When did it end? In what ways does 1789 constitute a rupture with the French Old Regime? The answers to these questions continue to have a surprising relevance. In this class, we will study the century and a half of French history prior to 1789 in some detail, then examine some of the central events and issues of the Revolution and its Napoleonic sequel.

Subject Requirements
--------------------

Attendance and class participation is mandatory. Students will write three 3-page papers, due in class on the dates indicated below, and a final paper of at least 10 pages in length. Each student will also present an oral report based on the final paper. I will hand out instructions for these assignments later in the semester. Each assignment will be weighted as follows in the calculation of the final grade, although these calculations will also take into account improved performance during the course of the semester:
